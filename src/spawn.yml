# Teleport Utils spawn config

# You can edit these values manually, or use the /setspawn command
# in game or using the server console to change them.

# When done in game, the values are 'cleaned up'. Examples below:
# X of 34.86 will become 34
# Yaw of 153 will become 180
# Pitch will always be 0

# You can always manualy edit the values in this yml file to use
# whatever position you want. Values are only corrected when done
# using the command by a player in game
